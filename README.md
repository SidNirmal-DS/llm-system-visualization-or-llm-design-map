# LLM System Design Patterns – Interactive Visualizer

This project is an interactive D3-based graph visualization of design patterns, techniques, and strategic pillars used in building LLM (Large Language Model) systems.

It helps researchers, engineers, and AI product managers explore and understand how various elements such as Data Foundations, Training, RAG, Agentic AI, and Reasoning techniques interconnect.
